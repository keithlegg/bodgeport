This is my attempt to document the work I did to convert an old bridgeport CNC machine to LinuxCNC

The first machine was converted in 2019. A second machine was purchased in 2025 - hence the two folders. 

The machines names are "buckaroo" (2019) and "shampoo" (2025), names inspired by my 8 year old son.
